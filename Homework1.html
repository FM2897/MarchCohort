            <li>Place the milk of your choice in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Using milk instead of water, makes this hot chocolate extra creamy and flavorful.</li>

            <li>Once the milk is warm, add finely chopped chocolate and stir for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the chocolate is fully melted and combined.</li>
            <li>Add a splash of vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, topped with your favorite garnishes: marshmallows, whipped cream, chopped chocolate, crushed candy canes or more.</li>
        </ol>
